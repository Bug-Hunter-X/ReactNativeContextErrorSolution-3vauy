This repository demonstrates a common React Native error related to missing context in nested components.  The `BugContext.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `BugContextSolution.js` provides a corrected version. The error occurs when a component requires a specific context but doesn't receive it, usually because a necessary context provider is missing further up the component tree. The solution involves ensuring proper use of React's Context API to provide the necessary context to child components.
